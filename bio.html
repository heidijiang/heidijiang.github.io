				<h2><b>ALL ABOUT PILAF</b></h2>
				<p>
					Pilaf is a very young man, whose sole goal in life is to enjoy the softest spot on the couch, with the greatest amount of blankets underneath him. He used to live in sunny Bay Area and was quite cross when he was unceremoniously transported to the Midwest. These days, he does enjoy tending to his snow fields during the winter, and his parents particularly enjoy the fart sounds his feet make when he runs around with rubber snow boots on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of Pilaf's favorite things include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tearing up toilet paper and then ingesting it</li>
					<li>Drinking lukewarm bath water ("hot human ham water")</li>
					<li>When there are treats in his mouth</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Some of Pilaf's least favorite things include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Physical activity</li>
					<li>Unexpected objects in his sightline (e.g., a floating plastic bag)</li>
					<li>When there are no treats in his mouth</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
